        The Blueprint Library is a place to share your Factorio blueprints. It is designed with speed and ease-of-use in
        mind, built on React and Node. While this site started as a school project, I intend to make it the central
        place to share and download Factorio blueprints. As I learn more about web development, this site will gain more
        features, more stability, and most importantly, mod support!
